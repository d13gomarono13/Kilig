I will research the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 and extract the core concept of 'Attention'. 

After ingesting the paper, I found that the core concept of "Attention" is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input data, rather than using the entire input. This is achieved by computing a weighted sum of the input elements, where the weights are learned during training and reflect the relative importance of each element.

The paper proposes a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This is done by applying multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, each with a different set of learnable weights.

The methodology used in the paper involves using self-attention mechanisms to compute the weighted sum of the input elements, and then using this weighted sum as input to a feed-forward neural network.

The results of the paper show that the proposed attention mechanism achieves state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks.

Using 'synthesize_critical_analysis', my findings can be summarized as follows:

* Core Concept: The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input data.
* Methodology: The paper proposes a multi-head attention mechanism, which uses self-attention to compute a weighted sum of the input elements.
* Results: The proposed attention mechanism achieves state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks.
* Validity: The conclusions are supported by the results, which show a significant improvement over baseline models.

I will now transfer my findings to the narrative agent for scripting.
