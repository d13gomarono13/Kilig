# Product Guidelines: Project Kilig

## Prose Style
- **Professional and Authoritative:** All user-facing text, including AI-generated scripts and UI labels, must be clear, direct, and academic. The tone should establish the platform as a reliable and sophisticated partner in scientific communication.

## Brand Messaging
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Prioritize simple yet powerful visualizations that distill complex scientific ideas into understandable narratives.
- **Empowering the Researcher:** Focus on how Kilig amplifies the researcher's voice and ability to communicate their findings to a broader audience.

## Visual Identity
- **Dynamic Motion:** Animations must feature smooth, intentional transitions. Every movement should serve a narrative purpose, guiding the viewer's eye through the logical flow of the scientific argument.

## AI Interaction
- **Invisible Enabler:** The AI should operate primarily behind the scenes. The user experience should focus on interacting with the data (SceneGraph) and the final video output, rather than constant interaction with an explicit "AI assistant." The technology should feel like a seamless extension of the user's workflow.
