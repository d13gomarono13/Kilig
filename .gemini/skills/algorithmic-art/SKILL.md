# Algorithmic Art

Create computational aesthetic movements expressed through code.

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)
- Name the movement (1-2 words)
- Articulate philosophy (4-6 paragraphs)
- Focus on: computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty
- Express through: seeded randomness, noise fields, particles, flows, forces

### Step 2: Express in Code (.html + .js)
- Use p5.js for generative algorithms
- 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters
- Include seed navigation for reproducibility

## Philosophy Examples

**"Organic Turbulence"** - Flow fields with layered Perlin noise, thousands of particles following vector forces

**"Quantum Harmonics"** - Particles with phase values exhibiting wave interference patterns

**"Recursive Whispers"** - Branching structures subdividing recursively with golden ratios

## Implementation Requirements

- Always use `randomSeed()` and `noiseSeed()` for reproducibility
- Include parameter controls (sliders, color pickers)
- Seed navigation (prev/next/random/jump)
- Single self-contained HTML artifact
- Use templates/viewer.html as starting point

## Essential Principles

- **Process over product** - Beauty in execution, not final frame
- **Parametric expression** - Ideas through mathematical relationships
- **Expert craftsmanship** - Meticulously refined through iteration
