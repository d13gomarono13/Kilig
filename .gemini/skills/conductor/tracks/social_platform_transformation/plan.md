# Social Platform Transformation: "The ArXiv Library"

## Objective
Transform Kilig from a simple tool-based dashboard into a social-media-style platform ("The ArXiv Library"). The new homepage will be a scrollable, engaging feed of scientific content (Comics & Videos) generated by AI and human illustrators.

## Core Philosophy
-   **Social First**: The primary interface is a feed, not a tool menu.
-   **Visual Science**: Content is king. Large previews, interactive panels, and "Vivacious" media.
-   **Community**: Users have profiles ("Laboratories") to showcase their work.
-   **Aesthetic**: Evolved Neo-Brutalism. Bold, distinctive, and scientifically rigorous.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core UI/UX Design (The "Feed") - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Design and implement the main scrollable feed interface.
- [x] **Design System Update**: Define the "Feed Card" component.
    -   Must support: Title, Abstract, Author, Tags, Interactive Preview (SmartPanel).
    -   Style: Neo-Brutalist with "Instagram" social actions (Like, Save, Share).
- [x] **Layout Implementation**: Create `web/src/pages/Feed.tsx`.
    -   Responsive Masonry or Grid layout (Changed to Vertical Feed).
    -   "Topic Selector" sticky header (Replaced with "Stories" rail).
- [x] **Mock Data**: Create a robust set of mock posts (Manifests) in `web/src/data/feed-data.ts`.

### Phase 2: Authentication & Routing - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Restructure the app entry point.
- [x] **New Landing Page**: Move current landing to `web/src/pages/Landing.tsx` (or remove if obsolete).
- [x] **Auth Guard**:
    -   Root path (`/`) checks auth status.
    -   If Guest -> Redirect to `/login` (New, high-design login page).
    -   If Authenticated -> Redirect to `/feed`.
- [x] **Navigation**: Update `Navbar` to reflect the new structure (Feed, Explore, Laboratory, Create).

### Phase 3: User Profile ("The Laboratory") - MOSTLY COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create the personal user space.
- [x] **Profile Page**: `web/src/pages/Profile.tsx`.
    -   Header: User stats (Papers Analyzed, Comics Created, Reputation).
    -   Tabs: "My Works", "Saved", "Drafts".
- [ ] **Edit Profile**: Settings for bio, field of study, and avatar. (UI exists, logic pending)

### Phase 4: Backend Integration - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Connect the frontend to real data.
- [x] **Supabase Schema**:
    -   `profiles` table (linked to auth.users).
    -   `posts` table (linked to comic manifests).
    -   `interactions` table (likes, saves).
- [x] **Data Fetching**: Replace mock data in `Feed.tsx` with Supabase queries.

### Phase 5: Recommendation Engine (Basic) - PENDING
**Goal**: Personalize the feed.
- [ ] **Tag Logic**: Simple algorithm to boost posts matching user's selected "Field of Study".
- [ ] **"For You" vs "Recent"**: Toggle in the feed header.

## Technical Stack
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for feed transitions).
-   **Data**: Supabase (PostgreSQL).
-   **State**: React Context or Zustand (for user session/feed state).
