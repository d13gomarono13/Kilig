# Literature Review

A rigorous skill for systematic, comprehensive literature reviews.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Define research question (use PICO for clinical)
2. Establish scope and objectives
3. Develop search strategy with Boolean operators
4. Set inclusion/exclusion criteria

### Phase 2: Search
1. Multi-database search (minimum 3):
   - **Biomedical**: PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv
   - **General**: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar
   - **Specialized**: ChEMBL, KEGG, UniProt
2. Document all search parameters
3. Export and aggregate results

### Phase 3: Screening
1. Deduplication by DOI/title
2. Title screening against criteria
3. Abstract screening
4. Full-text screening
5. Create PRISMA flow diagram

### Phase 4: Data Extraction
1. Extract key data from each study
2. Assess study quality (Cochrane ROB, Newcastle-Ottawa)
3. Organize by themes (3-5 major themes)

### Phase 5: Synthesis
- Organize by themes, NOT study-by-study
- Synthesize findings across studies
- Compare and contrast approaches
- Identify consensus and controversies

### Phase 6: Verification
**CRITICAL**: Verify all citations for accuracy before finalizing
