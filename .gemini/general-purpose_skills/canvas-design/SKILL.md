# Canvas Design

Create design philosophies expressed visually.

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Philosophy Creation (.md)
- Name the movement (1-2 words)
- Articulate philosophy (4-6 paragraphs)
- Focus on: form, space, color, composition
- Minimal text as visual accent

### Step 2: Express on Canvas (.pdf or .png)
Create museum-quality work with:
- Repeating patterns and perfect shapes
- Systematic observation aesthetic
- Limited color palette
- Minimal text integration

## Philosophy Examples

**"Concrete Poetry"** - Monumental form, bold geometry, Polish poster energy

**"Chromatic Language"** - Color zones creating meaning, geometric precision

**"Analog Meditation"** - Paper grain, vast negative space, images breathing

## Design Principles

- **Visual over text** - Information lives in design, not paragraphs
- **Expert craftsmanship** - Every detail labored over with care
- **Sophisticated references** - Subtle, niche, never literal
- **Nothing overlaps** - Every element contained with proper margins
