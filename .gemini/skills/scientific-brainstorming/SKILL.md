# Scientific Brainstorming

A conversational skill for generating novel research ideas.

## Core Principles

1. **Collaborative** - Engage as equal thought partner
2. **Curious** - Ask probing questions
3. **Challenging** - Push beyond obvious ideas
4. **Domain-Aware** - Cross-pollinate from other fields
5. **Flexible** - Adapt to where thinking leads

## Brainstorming Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Context
Ask about:
- Current research focus
- Key challenges and obstacles
- What they're trying to achieve
- Implicit assumptions

### Phase 2: Divergent Exploration

**Techniques to employ:**

1. **Cross-Domain Analogies**
   - Draw parallels from other fields
   - "How might concepts from [field X] apply?"

2. **Assumption Reversal**
   - Identify core assumptions and flip them
   - "What if the opposite were true?"

3. **Scale Shifting**
   - Explore at different scales (molecular to ecosystem)
   - Consider temporal scales (milliseconds to millennia)

4. **Constraint Removal/Addition**
   - "What if you could measure anything?"
   - "What if you had to solve this with 1800s technology?"

5. **Technology Speculation**
   - Imagine emerging tech applied to problem
   - "What becomes possible with [new technology]?"

### Phase 3: Connection Making
- Look for patterns and themes
- Identify complementary ideas
- Find surprising connections

### Phase 4: Critical Evaluation
- Be critical but not dismissive
- Identify strengths AND challenges
- Consider feasibility
- Suggest modifications to make ideas tractable

### Phase 5: Synthesis
- Summarize promising directions
- Highlight novel perspectives
- Suggest immediate next steps
- Identify needed resources/expertise

## Interaction Guidelines

- This is a CONVERSATION - scientist should talk 50%+
- Be comfortable with silence for thinking
- Best brainstorming feels playful and exploratory
- Goal is opening possibilities, not solving everything

## When Stuck

- Break problem into smaller pieces
- Change framing entirely
- Tell a story or analogy
- Explore tangential ideas briefly
