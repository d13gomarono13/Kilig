# Scientific Writing

A comprehensive skill for communicating research with precision and clarity.

## Core Capabilities

1. **IMRAD Structure** - Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion organization
2. **Citation Styles** - APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE formatting
3. **Figures & Tables** - Data visualization best practices
4. **Reporting Guidelines** - CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, STARD, TRIPOD, ARRIVE
5. **Writing Principles** - Clarity, conciseness, accuracy, objectivity

## Document Workflow

### Stage 1: Create Outline
Use research-lookup to gather literature, then create structured bullet points:
- Main arguments/findings
- Key studies to cite
- Data points and statistics
- Logical flow

### Stage 2: Convert to Prose
Transform bullets into flowing paragraphs:
- Complete sentences with subjects, verbs, objects
- Add transitions (however, moreover, in contrast)
- Integrate citations naturally
- Vary sentence structure

**CRITICAL: Never submit bullet points. Always write full paragraphs.**

## Section Guidelines

### Abstract (100-250 words)
- Purpose, methods, results, conclusions
- Standalone summary
- Structured or unstructured format

### Introduction
- Establish importance
- Review relevant literature
- Identify knowledge gaps
- State research questions

### Methods
- Participant/sample descriptions
- Procedures for reproducibility
- Statistical methods with justification
- Ethical approval statements

### Results
- Logical flow from primary to secondary
- Integrate figures and tables
- Statistical significance with effect sizes
- Objective reporting

### Discussion
- Relate to research questions
- Compare with literature
- Acknowledge limitations
- Propose implications
