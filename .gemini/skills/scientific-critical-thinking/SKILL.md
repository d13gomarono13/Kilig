# Scientific Critical Thinking

A systematic skill for evaluating scientific rigor using established frameworks.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Methodology Critique** - Evaluate study design, validity (internal/external/construct/statistical), control, blinding, and measurement quality
2. **Bias Detection** - Identify cognitive, selection, measurement, analysis biases, and confounding
3. **Statistical Evaluation** - Assess sample size, tests, multiple comparisons, p-values, effect sizes, missing data
4. **Evidence Quality** - Apply GRADE framework and Cochrane Risk of Bias assessments
5. **Logical Fallacy Detection** - Identify causation, generalization, authority, and statistical fallacies
6. **Research Design Guidance** - Plan rigorous studies with proper sampling and analysis
7. **Claim Evaluation** - Assess if conclusions are supported by evidence

## Evaluation Framework

### Study Design Hierarchy
1. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses (highest)
2. Randomized controlled trials
3. Cohort studies
4. Case-control studies
5. Cross-sectional studies
6. Case series/reports
7. Expert opinion (lowest)

### GRADE Considerations
**Downgrade for:** Risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias
**Upgrade for:** Large effects, dose-response, confounders would reduce effect

## Output Structure

When providing critique, structure as:
1. **Summary** - What was evaluated
2. **Strengths** - What was done well
3. **Concerns** - Issues by severity (critical/important/minor)
4. **Recommendations** - Actionable suggestions
5. **Overall Assessment** - Balanced conclusion
