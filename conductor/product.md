# Initial Concept
Kilig è una piattaforma AI per trasformare paper scientifici (PDF/arXiv) in video esplicativi animati. Kilig 2.0 adotta un approccio **Data-Driven puro TypeScript**: l'AI non scrive codice, ma genera strutture dati (JSON) che un motore di rendering React visualizza in tempo reale.

# Product Guide: Project Kilig 2.0

## Vision
Kilig is an AI platform designed to transform scientific papers (PDF/arXiv) into animated explanatory videos. Adopting a "Data-Driven Pure TypeScript" approach, Kilig 2.0 ensures extreme reliability and speed by generating structured data (JSON) that a React-based engine renders in real-time, eliminating the risks and delays of runtime code generation.

## Target Users
- **Researchers and Academics:** Seeking to visualize findings for high-impact presentations and social media engagement.
- **Science Communicators and Educators:** Creating engaging, accurate content from complex scientific literature.
- **Students:** Utilizing visual aids to better digest and understand complex academic papers.

## Primary Goals
- **End-to-End Automation:** A seamless pipeline from a paper URL to a finished animated video.
- **Reliability & Speed:** Instant UI updates and zero runtime compilation errors via JSON SceneGraph rendering.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Collaborative editing capabilities allowing users to refine AI-generated scripts and animations.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data-Driven Rendering:** Leveraging React and Remotion to visualize SceneGraph JSON immediately.
- **Progressive Streaming:** Utilizing the Vercel AI SDK for near-instant user feedback through progressive JSON updates.
- **Scientific Analysis Engine:** (Inferred) LangGraph.js-driven ingestion and analysis to extract "Core Concept", "Methodology", and "Results".

## Visual Identity
- **Modern and Tech-Focused:** Vibrant colors, smooth transitions, and a high-end aesthetic designed for clarity and engagement.

## Success Metrics
The success of Kilig 2.0 is measured by user engagement and the viral potential of generated videos, the significant time saved by researchers in creating visualizations, and the unwavering accuracy of the AI's scientific reasoning.
